# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

 

## Introduction

In the introduction to this course, I learned how to use GitHub, GitBash, and Visual Studios Codes. I also learned how to push and pull files into my GitHub Repository from Visual Studios Codes. I am starting to learn a little bit about JavaScript and the cool stuff that you can do with that language. I am looking forward to learning about the JQuery library because it seems that it will be very useful to utilize scripts and procedures that others have already developed.  I am certain that my web pages will benefit from this approach! I am particularly interested in using a JQuery script to insert a navbar on each page, so that when I make changes, I donâ€™t have to update each page, but will be able to make a single modification and have all the pages updated.

 

## Chapter 1

In Chapter 1, I wrote my first JavaScript program! It was kind of underwhelming, only adding an alert box to a web page. But it gave me a hint about how convenient it is to use JavaScript for page modification and add-ons.  It seems like there is so much more that you can do with scripts than with HTML/CSS alone.  The Console (I use Chrome mostly) is an excellent way to identify and diagnose errors in coding.  However, the IDE (Visual Studios Code) also has a pretty good interface to figure out errors, so the Console may just serve as a back-up resource. 

## Chapter 2

Chapter 2 introduced the concept of ##variables; they can be numbers, strings, or Boolean values. This is identical to their use in Python or Java. Arrays in JavaScript are like lists of variables. Interestingly, you can have different types of data in an array. There are multiple ways to add to or delete from them. You can add a single variable or multiple variables to the beginning or end of the array, and you can delete single variable from both ends as well.  Finally, I learned about commenting and its usefulness. I recognize that sometimes my commenting is skimpy and I will try to be more thorough in future comments.

## Chapter 3

Chapter 3 introduces ##conditional ##statements and describes how their answers are Boolean; the statements are either true or false. If statements can evaluate more than one condition, and the statement can be set up to be true if any one of the subcomponents is true OR only if all are true.  Conditional statements can be nested to describe complex conditions.  In addition to IF statements, JavaScript also utilizes For and Do/While loops to iterate over a condition.  A specific query or task can be saved as a function, which can then be inserted into code later on.
