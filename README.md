# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-280 Client Side Scripting course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

 

## Introduction

In the introduction to this course, I learned how to use GitHub, GitBash, and Visual Studios Codes. I also learned how to push and pull files into my GitHub Repository from Visual Studios Codes. I am starting to learn a little bit about JavaScript and the cool stuff that you can do with that language. I am looking forward to learning about the JQuery library because it seems that it will be very useful to utilize scripts and procedures that others have already developed.  I am certain that my web pages will benefit from this approach! I am particularly interested in using a JQuery script to insert a navbar on each page, so that when I make changes, I donâ€™t have to update each page, but will be able to make a single modification and have all the pages updated.

 

## Chapter 1

In Chapter 1, I wrote my first JavaScript program! It was kind of underwhelming, only adding an alert box to a web page. But it gave me a hint about how convenient it is to use JavaScript for page modification and add-ons.  It seems like there is so much more that you can do with scripts than with HTML/CSS alone.  The Console (I use Chrome mostly) is an excellent way to identify and diagnose errors in coding.  However, the IDE (Visual Studios Code) also has a pretty good interface to figure out errors, so the Console may just serve as a back-up resource.
